        text: "When I have trouble starting to a task it's usually because I focus too much on the mountain of work ahead and worry about stuff I cannot influence at that moment. Finishing the biggest part of a task feels very good but is a horrible starting point. I would start with the easiest step of a task to get myself motivated and maybe even do another small step before then taking a break. Getting a task done as fast as possible feels good and relieving but it really tires you out very fast and itâ€™s rather demotivating. Doing things one step at a time is the way to go for me. Try to not look too far ahead and focus on the here and now the rest will happen naturally.",
